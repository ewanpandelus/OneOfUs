  dialogue:
  - You don't know the full story. I don't have to.
  - In the contract he gave me for the loan repayments it said nothing about when
    I have to pay him by.
  - So I don't care if he wants his money back, I don't have to give it to him.
  response:
  - That's a real shame, guess I'll have to beat the money out of you.
  - What if I told you that you were wrong about the contract?
