  dialogue:
  - The dock worker, Clyde. He hasn't paid me back the money he owes me.
  - You wouldn't be able to go and get me my money back, would you?
  - I'd do it myself but I've been so busy with the shop that I haven't had the chance.
  response:
  - I think, I'd rather the Saviour strike me down instead.
  - That sounds like a you problem. (Walk away.)
